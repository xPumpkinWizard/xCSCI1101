189332,1692,Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising,"While the Allied Nations were still recovering from the war in Cosmo Land, the Black Hole Army had already recovered and has decided to launch a large-scale invasion on Macro Land. Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.

Once the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.

The Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered. Hawke takes over as leader of Black Hole, and along with Flak, Lash, and Adder, leaves Macro Land with the few troops he has left.",2003-06-24 00:00:00.000,13,NULL,90.5000,2,85.8395,36

168926,129851,Age of Mythology: Gold Edition,"AoM: 
Like many other real-time strategy games, Age of Mythology is based on defeating enemy units and towns, building your own units and towns, and training villagers and fighters. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four ""Ages"": starting in the Archaic Age, the player may upgrade to the Classical Age, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. However, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid and a certain prerequisite building to be constructed. 
 
There are three playable cultures in Age of Mythology: the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each culture has three ""major gods""—important deities such as Ra, Zeus, or Odin. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a ""minor god"" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include Bast and Aphrodite. All gods grant the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique ""god power""—A one-time special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it. 
 
 
AoM - The Titans: 
The story begins with Kronos, who is still trapped in Tartarus, watching the Atlanteans, who are attempting to survive the harsh winters in the Norselands after Atlantis was destroyed 10 years ago in the events of Age of Mythology. He sends his unnamed servant to the colony, who kills the Theocrat Krios and possesses his body. Krios tells of a temple he saw in a vision. The Atlanteans leave the Norselands by using the foreseen temple called a Sky Passage, and they come to a resourceful island. Upon their arrival, Krios points out the plant-covered Temples to Oranos and Kronos. He convinces everyone including Kastor to worship them. This angers the Greeks, who promptly attack them. The Atlanteans retaliate by destroying the entire Greek colony. The survivors tell of their defeat to General Melagius. The Atlanteans invade Melagius' city called Sikyos, and slay him. Just as the Atlanteans kill Melagius, his Egyptian and Norse allies come to aid the city. Kastor decides they are too powerful and retreats. He decides to attack their homelands while they are heavily defending Greece. In the Norselands, Kastor destroys Norse temples and replaces them with Atlantean temples, to show his superiority. He also destroys the Tower of Odin (Odin's only stronghold on Earth) by using a god power from Kronos. 
 
Some Atlantean forces then sail to Egypt. Queen Amanra is warned by Arkantos that the Atlanteans are coming to steal relics from the Egyptians. Amanra fortifies the protections around the relics, but the Atlanteans still manage to steal them. Arkantos protects Amanra from Atlantean soldiers then tells her that Kastor is being tricked. He tells her to find Kastor and to help him. Meanwhile, Krios congratulates Kastor on his work and shows him a Sky Passage that he has found, which will take him behind Greek lines. Kastor enters it and finds himself on Mount Olympus. Using special temples that change his men into different myth units, Kastor slays the followers of the Olympian Gods, including Odysseus. However, once he does this, the temple to Zeus on the mountain collapses. Back in Greek territories, the Titan Prometheus and his army of Prometheans from Tartarus are destroying Sikyos. Krios arrives and announces that Kastor's actions in Greece, Egypt and the Norselands, combined with his invasion of Olympus, have weakened the Olympian Gods' control over these territories and allowed minor titans to spawn. Krios reveals his true form, a winged demon and servant of Kronos, and flees.",2003-09-30 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

167405,1135,Castlevania: Lament of Innocence,"Lament of Innocence is set in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series. Set in 1094, it focuses on the origins of the series' premise—the conflict between the vampire-hunting Belmont clan and the vampire Dracula. The protagonist and primary player character of Lament of Innocence is Leon Belmont, a former baron and member of the Belmont clan. His close friend, Mathias Cronqvist, tells him that Leon's betrothed, Sara, is being held captive by the vampire Walter Bernhard. During the game, he encounters Rinaldo Gandolfi, an alchemist and resident of the forest outside Walter’s castle.

Arriving on the castle grounds, Leon meets Rinaldo, who gives him a whip crafted by alchemy to assist in killing the monsters and enchants his gauntlet so he is able to use magic relics within the castle. Leon also learns that he must defeat five monsters to gain access to Walter's throne room. Arriving at the castle, Leon proceeds to defeat the five monsters, including Joachim, a vampire kept prisoner in the castle by Walter. Before dying, Joachim mentions the Ebony and Crimson Stones, both of which are created from alchemy, and explains to Leon that the Ebony Stone can produce darkness. From Rinaldo, Leon learns that the Crimson Stone converts the souls of vampires into power for its holder.

After Leon reaches Walter’s quarters, he rescues Sara and attempts to slay him with the whip, to no effect. At Rinaldo's cottage, it is revealed that Sara is slowly becoming a vampire. Rinaldo reveals that Leon must sacrifice Sara to make the whip effective against Walter. Overhearing their conversation, Sara begs him to kill her and use her soul to save others from suffering her fate. Leon reluctantly completes the ritual, creating the Vampire Killer whip.

Devastated by the loss of Sara, Leon returns to the castle to confront Walter and defeats him. Death takes Walter's soul and offers it up to Mathias; Mathias appears and reveals he had orchestrated everything to obtain his soul and convert it into power for himself using the Crimson Stone. Mathias explains that he chose immortality as a vampire so he could curse God for taking away his beloved wife. He offers Leon the same, but a disgusted Leon refuses. Mathias orders Death to kill Leon, but Leon defeats Death, vowing that the Belmont clan will hunt down Mathias and destroy him one day. The game's epilogue reveals that Mathias became Dracula, the series' main antagonist.",2003-10-21 00:00:00.000,9,NULL,78.0000,3,79.2965,35

151881,11272,Chaser,"Mars, 2044. The UN establishes MARSCORP (Martian Security and Economics Committee) under the leadership of Samuel Longwood. In the years that follow, the UN gradually loses control of MARSCORP, mainly due to the non-transparent licence policy of its director. Longwood uses his autonomous status to create vassal relations between the corporations and MARSCORP. The unshakable power position of MARSCORP is supported by the companies and thus they acquire additional rights and licenses. Longwood and his consortium become extremely wealthy from this arrangement. However, dissenting voices in MARSCORP begin to challenge Samuel Longwood's authoritarian policy. They demand his dismissal as director and a complete redistribution of the mining rights.
But Samuel Longwood keeps an ace up his sleeve for occasions like this…
John Chaser is a man without memory or friends. Alone, in the middle of a bloody conflict, he is trying to find out who he is. His extraordinary fighting abilities enable him to survive, but they raise more questions than they answer. Chaser awakens on board the spaceship H.M.S. Majestic. He doesn't know who he is, what he's doing here, why he is being sought by men in black uniforms and what they will do to him when they find him…
The player's goal is to find out who Chaser really is and why he is being hunted. The story leads the player from the H.M.S. Majestic to Montack City on Earth, then on to Siberia and finally to Mars, where the trail ends and hopefully the truth can be found.",2003-08-22 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,69.5000,2,64.3749,17

DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.

Everything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who's there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.
Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy.

""All God's Village""), a ""[l]ost"" settlement where the majority of the game takes place. The player learns that Minakami Village was host to the ""Crimson Sacrifice Ritual"", the failure of which caused the settlement to vanish—thus earning it the name ""The Lost Village"".

The protagonists of Fatal Frame II are Mio and Mayu Amakura, twin sisters who are visiting their favorite childhood playspot in Minakami before it is lost in the dam construction. The main antagonist is the vengeful spirit of Sae Kurosawa, the sole Twin Shrine Maiden sacrificed for the failed ritual. She yearns to reunite with her twin sister Yae, whom she mistakes Mio for, and uses Mayu to try and complete the ritual with her. Other characters include the spirit of Itsuki Tachibana, a young man who also mistakes Mio for Yae, but instead tries to help her and Mayu escape; and Seijiro Makabe, a folklorist who visited Minakami Village with a Camera Obscura prototype (the same camera Mio uses in the game) and his assistant, Ryozo Munakata.[20] Makabe later became a temporary sacrifice for the Abyss, known as a Kusab.

As Frank you can freely roam the city in search of nude pictures of women. Certain women are more than willing to repay you with one naked picture of theirs if necessary conditions are met (like for example giving them a certain item) but chances are that some pictures can be found in the most unlikely places as well. Frank starts with a medium health bar and a sum of money. Health points which are lost if hit by a car can be replenished by eating food. Money are needed to bribe women so as to get a picture of them or for buying items that the women may request to trade for one of their pictures. More money can be gained by either playing games in the casino or by selling the pictures you have already acquired to the boss of the Boobs Illustrated magazine.",2003-10-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Since the revelations of the true causes behind the 2nd Huffman Conflict in 2092, the world grew wary of the Republic of Zaftra. Zaftra began losing foreign investments and many businesses withdrew from the union, resulting in major economic losses. Superpowers such as the United States of the New Continent (USN) refused offers from the union to import their natural resources, the major economic driver of their economy. With a failing economy and growing distrust from the world community, the Republic of Zaftra disbanded the Peace Mediation Organization (PMO) in 2094. Meanwhile, the discovery of natural resources in Poland led the European Community (EC) to stop importing raw materials from Zaftra. Consequently, Zaftran citizens began migrating to other countries in search for work. In 2096, the Republic of Zaftra returned to the spotlight after a mysterious blitzkrieg of EC military bases leaves Europe in an imminent resource crisis.

The skirmish eventually ends with one destroyed train and the brothers in the town of New Heissgart, looking for a ride to Central. There, they meet a girl named Armony and learn more of the Philosopher's Catalyst, an item nearly as powerful as the Philosopher's Stone itself, but used to increase the efficiency of alchemy. The Philosopher's Catalyst seems to be directly linked with the berserk chimeras running about, the rogue military force, and the gathering of alchemists in the town.

F-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off.

Falcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil.

At his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)",2003-07-25 00:00:00.000,11,NULL,90.0000,3,78.0650,46

Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t.
Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.

Someone who was alive last night is dead now.
And someone who is here right now isn’t alive.

So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up.
But don’t give up.

Only you can stand up to this.",2003-08-15 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.0000,2

Jak, Daxter, Samos and Keira are in the process of activating the rift rider, the precursor device hidden behind the large door at the end of Precursor Legacy, and its accompanying rift gate. When the gate is activated a large figure steps out, accompanied by a swarm of creatures. Jak panics and activates the rift rider, propelling the group through the gate. As they are travelling through the rift, the rider is destroyed. The group fall out of the rift and are separated, though all find themselves in Haven City. Jak and Daxter land and are immediately identified by a patrol of the Krimzon Guard, led by Captain Erol. Jak is taken into custody, as Daxter promises to rescue him (see the events of Daxter). Two years later, Jak is in the Fortress, where he has been the subject of a super soldier program. His body has been infused with dark eco. Erol and the Baron Praxis are there. They declare the 'Dark Warrior Program' a failure. They leave, just as Daxter appears to rescue Jak. As Daxter fidgets with the restraints, Jak transforms into the Dark Warrior Program's ultimate goal, Dark Jak. He breaks the binds and then returns to normal, after speaking his first words, ""I'm going to kill Praxis!""

This causes a paradox that changes time for the worse, and separates Kain and Raziel. 
 
Kain's part of the game follows him seeking Moebius the Time Streamer, a time traveling mystic for answers to where Raziel is, how he has changed time, and later following a lead Moebius gives him to explore a Vampire citadel. During his quest, Kain finds and completes a broken talisman of Vampire construct known as the Balance Emblem. Kain discovers murals during his quest dictating an ancient war between the first races to inhabit Nosgoth, the Ancient vampires and the Hylden. After sealing the Hylden in an alternate dimension using the Pillars of Nosgoth, the Hylden cursed the Ancients with blood-thirst, sterility and immortality, turning them into the first Vampires. Kain discovers from the murals that it was prophesied that both races would have a champion arise - a Vampire champion wielding the Soul Reaver, and a Hylden champion wielding a flaming sword. Because he possesses the material Soul Reaver depicted, Kain comes to believe he is the prophesied Vampire champion.

195855,1971,Manhunt,"The game takes place in the gritty crime-infested Carcer City. The story opens with a female journalist reporting on the convict James Earl Cash, a criminal on death row who has supposedly been executed by lethal injection. Cash is awoken to the voice of a person coming from an earpiece, revealing that Cash was only sedated. Cash puts on the earpiece and the person, who refers to himself as ""The Director"", promises Cash his freedom before the night is over, but only if Cash follows the Director's instructions. Released in a dingy neighborhood, Cash is directed to slaughter his way through the streets, populated by a gang calling themselves The Hoods while the Director, watching through security cameras scattered throughout the city, repeatedly mentions the need to please the audiences, revealing his occupation as a snuff film director. However, despite the Director's promise of freedom, Cash is beaten and thrown into the back of a van by a group of mercenaries known as the Cerberus.

After his battle against the Hoods, he is also hunted by other violent gangs in various locations across the city. The gangs are organized by Ramirez, an ex-soldier and leader of the Wardogs, a gang of army veterans and experienced hunters. First, Cash is pitted against a gang of white supremacists known as The Skinz in a scrap yard. After that, faces off against Ramirez's Wardogs in an abandoned zoo where Cash has to save kidnapped members of his own family. Following the zoo encounter, Cash is forced to battle a gang of devil worshipers and perverts known as the The Innocentz in an abandoned mall. After retrieving a video tape in the mall and finding a VCR player, Cash witnesses his family being slaughtered by The Innocentz. Betrayed, Cash is forced to endure the humiliating task of escorting a drunken hobo through the hostile streets of East Los Albos. After finishing off the Innocentz in a derelict chemical factory, Cash takes on a gang of psychotics, known as The Smileys, who have taken over a mental asylum. Here, Cash survives the ending to the snuff film as planned by the Director. Consequently, the remaining Wardogs and Ramirez are hired to kill Cash. However, Ramirez and his gang are killed by Cash, and Cash quickly turns on the Director.

The Carcer City Police Department (CCPD), are working for the Director; the CCPD are ordered by the Director to re-capture or kill Cash. However, the journalist seen at the game's beginning encounters Cash and imparts that she is on a mission to expose the Director's snuff film industry and CCPD corruption, and that Cash is vital for this important task; the journalist also reveals the Director's name is Starkweather. Protecting her from the police, Cash manages to take the journalist safely to her apartment, but Cash himself is re-captured by Cerberus. Back at Starkweather's mansion, he is ordered to be killed by Cerberus. However, Piggsy, an insane, chainsaw-wielding man, who wears a pig's head as a mask and was kept chained up in Starkweather's attic, has broken free and slaughters the investigating Cerberus. This allows Cash to work his way through the garden and mansion, killing the Cerberus leader along the way. Cash finally reaches the upper levels of the mansion, where he and Piggsy stalk one another. Cash triumphs after luring Piggsy onto a trapdoor that collapses, and as Piggsy tries to hold on, Cash chainsaws Piggsy's hands off, sending Piggsy falling to his death. After hacking his way through the last of the Cerberus, Cash finally confronts Starkweather and despite his pleas, brutally disembowels and decapitates him with the chainsaw. Soon, the press turns up at the mansion with the journalist exposing Starkweather's snuff ring and the police's involvement in Starkweather's operations.

28429,125378,Mata Nui Online Game II: The Final Chronicle,"One night, a storm ravaged Ga-Koro, and Hahli had to repair the bridge to the rest of Ga-Koro from the lily pad that her and Amaya's huts on the outer edge of the village. She performed errands for the other Ga-Matoran and spoke with Nixie, who showed her a formula to find coordinates based on the six Toa. Nokama, recently returned from a Turaga meeting, announced the villages would hold a Kolhii Tournament, and chose Hahli over Kotu to play for Ga-Koro, with Macku as her defense player. While talking with the other Ga-Matoran, Hahli received the Charm from Shasa representing Unity, the Speed Charm from Kai, and the Purity Charm from Marka. Pelagia took Hahli into Naho Bay to swim with a Takea to improve her Speed. When Onepu and Taipu came to play the Ga-Matoran, Hahli used her Speed to get the better of the team. The Onu-Matoran invited her to Onu-Koro, where she explored the Marn Tunnels. After diving in the now flooded Great Mine to recover mining equipment, she helped Azibo recover his Sluice, and he gave Hahli the Prosperity Charm in return. Taipu trained Hahli in the Onu-Matoran discipline of Stamina and gave her its Charm. Hahli also met Nuparu, who gave her fitness check-ups.

Hahli had to go to Ko-Koro for the approaching Kolhii match. While exploring, she met Jaatikko and Toudo, who gave her the Destiny Charm and Peace Charm, respectively. Hahli traversed The Drifts and found Kantai, who trained her in Willpower and gave her its Charm. Using Willpower and Stamina, Hahli defeated Matoro and Kopeke in the match. Arriving in Le-Koro, Hahli was greeted by Kongu and Matau and found the Faith Charm. During training in Accuracy with Bamboo Disks under Tamaru, Hahli found the Accuracy Charm. Using her improved Accuracy, Hahli won the match against Kongu and Tamaru, and left for Po-Koro. In Po-Koro, she learned about Creation from Hewkii and found its Charm. She practiced in Strategy with Golyo by herding Mahi and also found its Charm. In the subsequent match, she used her new skills to defeat Hafu and Hewkii. Leaving the village, she travelled to Ta-Koro to play Jaller and Takua, and Jaller directed her to Keahi to train in Strength. After learning about the last Principle of Courage from Kapura, she used her full knowledge of the Skills and Principles to defeat Ta-Koro, securing a spot in the Championship.

In the Championship, the Ga-Koro team played against Po-Koro and Ta-Koro at the Ta-Koro Kolhii Stadium, and Hahli and Macku won narrowly. At the end of the game, the Mask of Light slipped out of Jaller's bag, leading the Turaga to proclaim Jaller the herald of the Seventh Toa and set him upon a quest. Hahli wanted to speak to Jaller, but he had to leave quickly on his quest. Trying to find him, she found the Courage Charm in Jaller's home the and Duty Charm at the Wall of History. She returned to Ga-Koro and looked at the formula Nixie had showed her. Because of the announcement of the Seventh Toa, she used seven as the base number instead six, calculating a coordinate in Naho Bay. Pelagia sailed her to the coordinate, and Hahli found the Temple of Purity in the ocean She located the Crystal of Purity deep in the ocean, and unlocked its Temple with the Charms. After showing the Crystal to Nixie, Hahli went to find the other temples. In Onu-Koro, Hahli swam again in the Great Mine, diving to the bottom to find the Temple of Prosperity. Unlocking it, she retrieved the Crystal of Prosperity and swam back up to the surface. The Drifts contained the Temple of Peace, a grouping of three statues Hahli unlocked to reveal another Crystal. In Le-Wahi, the highest tree-top contained the Temple of Faith, and using Charms she retrieved the Crystal of Faith. The Temple of Creation was a statue half covered in sand in Po-Wahi, that Hahli entered to retrieve the Crystal of Creation. With five Crystals, Hahli returned to Ta-Koro to look for the final Temple, Charm, and Crystal.

Arrival of the Rahkshi

Hahli unlocking the Crystal's secret
Three Rahkshi suddenly attacked Ta-Koro, but Hahli was able to raise the bridge so the Matoran could escape. Confronted by Lerahk, she fled Ta-Koro as it was destroyed and ran into Ta-Wahi. Hahli stumbled upon the Temple of Courage and found Courage's Charm. Using it to enter the Temple, she found the last Crystal. Wandering the Ta-Wahi Beach, Hahli found the Great Telescope and a carving of The Legend of Mata Nui. Noticing slots in the carving, Hahli inserted the Crystals, and was teleported to Kini-Nui where she watched as three more Rahkshi flew overhead.

When Jaller died and Takua transformed into Takanuva, Hahli mourned Jaller deeply. Once the Toa built the Ussanui, she placed his mask upon the helm to lead Takanuva to victory and a new light. She then hid in the Ussanui and traveled with Takanuva into Mangaia for his conflict with Makuta Teridax. There, Takanuva sent her to bring the other Turaga and Toa Nuva from the surface. This incited quarreling among the islanders, whom Hahli quieted with a hopeful speech about Jaller and the Three Virtues. After Takanuva defeated Teridax and transformed with him into Takutanuva, he lifted the gate for the Matoran. When Hahli ran by with Jaller's mask, Takutanuva stopped her and gave up part of his life force to bring Jaller back to life. Takutanuva then perished, and Takanuva emerged from the rubble of the gate.

Hahli was given the position of Chronicler by Nokama, and was one of a handful of Matoran who witnessed the Turaga tell the tales of their adventures as Toa Metru and Toa Hordika, recording the legends in her position as Chronicler.",2003-06-26 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

181778,26359,MU Online,"In a millennium's time, the Land of MU has advanced and developed the empire in great bounding strides. However, as foretold in the Great Prophecy, Secromicon, the Continent of MU fell into overwhelming chaos. Great leaders who had once controlled the MU Continent now have fallen low, and the central government; due to the internal strife and warfare amongst power hungry feudal lords, have brought the kingdom asunder and thus the empire crumbled. The millennium of peace and bounty is now a mere memory and dark stains of blood now cover the land. The ravages of war have laid waste to the once beautiful land and the shedding of blood still knows no end. Even now, petty feudal lords endlessly build up their machines of war and futilely attempt to re-establish what once was.

And it was during this time of endless blood letting that the Gates of Hell were thrown open as the blind ambitions of a foolish man had been led far astray.

Antonias a foolish Lord, blinded by ambition, deceived by the evil Sorceress Lemulia, unknowingly let loose upon the world, Kundun, the Devil of Darkness, a demon difficultly confined by the Seal of Etramu.

""Now this land shall be mine again. I have banished Peace for all time… the Sun will no longer shine. This earth shall be mine, and cunning men will be my slaves and cattle.""

The Ancient Devil Kundun awake from its long sleepless slumber now walks amongst the living defiling the land with his touch. Amidst the chaos, the stars have lost their course and the stench of fear and blood pervades throughout. Kundun released upon the land his rage and vengeance for his long confinement. Quickly, the now forsaken land of MU has become home to Kundun's minions and for 2 long years the evil of his reign befouled all that was once pure. Nightmare's Day, a passage in the Great Prophecy, had come true and was no longer merely the words of days gone by. Wise men began their studies anew and hopingly and longingly referred to the ray of light mentioned within the writings of the prophecy. Their last remaining hope lay in the power of the seal of Etramu, the very seal that maintained Kundun's imprisonment. Into 8 pieces the seal has been scattered and only when the seal is made whole shall peace return to the land once more.",2003-10-06 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,62.6338,14

Revolution,"In Phantasy Star Online Episodes I and II, the spaceship Pioneer 2 arrived at the uninhabited planet Ragol in hopes of colonization in response to the failing ecosystem of the home planet Coral. In Episode III, Pioneer 2 remains in orbit above Ragol, but still has not begun colonization. The inner strife of the government of Pioneer 2, which has since gained independence from Coral, in addition to the exploitation of the planet's resources prevent colonization. 
 
The government of Pioneer 2 also hopes to exploit ""the germ"", a mysterious substance discovered on the planet, which they use to power the newly developed ""C.A.R.D. technology"", which is used to store items such as weapons as cards and allow them to be used much more efficiently.[1] C.A.R.D. is an acronym for ""compressed alternate reality data"". The game can be played as either the ""Heroside"" or the ""Darkside"". The ""Heroside"" are government-appointed officials, who take orders from the government to explore, research, and capture the Arkz, an anti-government faction. The ""Darkside"" are the Arkz, founded by a man known only as Red. The Arkz try to intercept and destroy the government's plans for the exploitation of the planet. They also oppose the use of C.A.R.D. technology due to its unpredictability and the lack of complete understanding of the germ. They still, however, use a stolen version of the technology in order to be able to compete with Heroside. Both sides also search for the location of the ""Great Shadow"", which is believed to be the source of the germ. 
 
Within the two factions, each character has their own goals and aspirations, and playing as certain characters in battle will reveal different aspects of the story. When both sides of the story are completed, one after another, it is discovered that the government, while experimenting with the germ for clone technology, is attempting to create bio-soldiers with the genetic material of Red's deceased twin daughters. The final boss for Heroside is a rejected mutated clone of Pollux. The final boss for Darkside is a rejected mutated clone of the other twin, Castor. After completing the storylines and their boss battles, there is a final battle with the source of the germ, Amplam Umbra. Once the source is destroyed, Pioneer 2 finally lands on Ragol, and the colonization of the planet begins.",2003-11-27 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,74.0000,2

120938,141135,Real Madrid Club Football,"Club Football is a soccer series designed to re-create the individual team experience. A total of 17 games released in the Club Football series are tailored to the specific European teams on which they are based, including character facial mapping from each of the 22 position players on the roster. Authentic uniforms, stadiums, and play styles are all included as part of the featured team. The following 17 clubs are available in the series, seven of which are from the United Kingdom: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester United, Rangers, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg SV, FC Bayern Munich, Ajax, FC Barcelona, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Juventus, and The Celtic Football Club.

Each game features bespoke content - including media archive clips of great goals and famous victories - and allows fans to add themselves to the 2003/04 starting line-up of their favourite side. Featuring photo-realistic player likenesses and stadia, and authentic crowd chants.

Codemasters have put together a range of different Club Football games, each centred on one of Europe's top teams. UK club editions include Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Leeds United, Liverpool FC, Manchester United and Rangers. The Club Football development team has been busy digitally building some of Europe's greatest football landmarks: the home stadium of each team. In the game, matches will be played in an exact replica of each club's stadium, recreated using architectural detail and photographic reference.

Playing a game will be just like experiencing the genuine match day atmosphere in the ground--with you as part of the team. During a home match, you and your team will walk out onto the hallowed turf through the players' tunnel. The stadium, packed with supporters in the teams' colours, will fill with the sound of chants, songs and crowd atmospherics taken from real match days, specific to each club. Ten different in-game camera views, in addition to replay cameras, will relay the on-pitch action in televisual style.

The only football game dedicated to real fans and real clubs
Score in a faithful replica of your club's home ground
A totally immersive experience with fully accurate strips, sponsors, and chants from your team's fans

THO knows that this goal cannot be attained while there are powers capable of challenging them, and aims to use its connections and advanced technology to make sure the two sides of WWII devastate each other, while THO makes a grab for power when both are exhausted. The obvious influence of Norse mythology on the organization's name is further shown by the fact that all THO members use a mythological name as their call sign.

In exchange for the services of both Allied and Axis higher-ups, Thor's Hammer provides them with some of their inventions, including Panzerkleins. Panzerkleins are very difficult to destroy, as they are essentially immune to small arms fire.",2003-11-07 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,80.0000,1,79.5771,15

When a tribe of echidnas sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself.

After being lost for millennia, the weapon, known as the Gizoid, was unearthed and researched by Professor Gerald Robotnik. It remained dormant for another half century before being discovered by, of all people, Gerald's grandson, Dr. Eggman. Frustrated at his inability to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, Eggman dumped it at Emerald Beach where it was found once more, this time by Sonic the Hedgehog.

Sonic names the Gizoid ""Emerl"", who gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, both allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, Gamma, Rouge, and Shadow, Emerl turns from a soulless robot into a fun-loving mech with personality traits from all of those he had met. But while the gang is having fun raising their new mechanical friend, there are those who recognize Emerl's true power. Now that Emerl is working again, Eggman has his eye on it, Rouge wants to turn it into a master thief, and Shadow feels that, despite Sonic's efforts to humanize him, Emerl is still a weapon of mass destruction.",2003-12-04 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,75.0000,1,60.8918,25

Though it has no multiplayer, the game does offer a great deal of content in the form of a comprehensive single-player campaign, a series of skirmish missions, and an open-ended sandbox mode. Plus, there's a map editor you can use to create your own levels.

136495,314,SWAT: Global Strike Team,"SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM was formed in 2008 in response to an unprecedented escalation of threats of violence against civilians around the world by a well-organized and highly ruthless transnational criminal network bent on destabilizing democracy for its own benefit.

In a secret crisis summit of the UN Security Council in Moscow, the leaders of the free world unanimously agreed that the best way to engage this common foe was to form a global police force whose structure could parallel or mirror that of the criminal network itself.

SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is composed of the cream of police officers from the best tactical units in the world, including some who served in OPERATION URBAN JUSTICE in previous years, as well as ex-special forces personnel from various militaries. It is based on the concept that different nationalities with knowledge of local criminal environments can readily pool their intelligence and expertise to anticipate and prevent the enemy from achieving their goals. Those selected for SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM do tours of duty around the world before returning to their previous vocations. Most choose to stay...

SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is the muscle, the business end of a worldwide policy to streamline the law enforcement agencies of civilized nations in a sustained effort to coordinate a response to the real threat posed by the criminal network. SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM was therefore designed to work alongside more traditional law enforcement agencies and military/defense organizations throughout the world.

You are Mathias Kincaid, a former member of the US Army's elite Delta Force and now a commander within SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM. Having volunteered for GST duty, your wish has finally been granted. As element leader, you will be teamed up with two first lieutenants, a sharpshooting sniper named Kana Lee, and Anthony ""TJ"" Jackson, an excellent field technician.

A major threat to world security has arisen: two rival gangs, the ""Omega Cartel"" (Executive High Rollers) and the ""Whispering Dragon Clan"" (Urban Street Warriors) - in reality organizations - are fighting a bitter turf war over the production and distribution of a deadly new designer drug, LD-50 - nicknamed SPIKE. The Omega Cartel owns the production and distribution arm, but the new boys on the street, the Dragons, want to tax the Omega Cartel or gain access to their territory.

This war has spilled out onto the streets of the world's major cities, terrorizing ordinary decent citizens. Airports have been closed down due to bomb threats, waves of car bomb attacks have swept the US, Europe, and the former Soviet Union, and street gunfights have spread beyond LA into the heartland of the US. In several major European cities, huge areas are considered virtual war zones and have effectively been abandoned by conventional police forces.

To meet this threat, a global police response is needed. And so SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is called in with orders to destroy both narco-terrorist organizations.",2003-10-28 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,64.5000,3,NULL,NULL

In Gensokyo, people relax and bask in the calm of a winter without end. Spring has shown no sign of arriving even though it's already May, and in fact the snowstorms are continually getting worse. Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, is tired of being cold day in and day out and wants to find the source of this unnatural weather. Marisa Kirisame, a black-clothed magician, sees a cherry blossom petal float down outside her warm house and wonders if spring is happening somewhere else. Sakuya Izayoi, the maid leader of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, knows that their winter supplies are diminishing quickly, and wants to end this prolonged winter before they run out completely. Depending on who you choose, only one of these three heroines actually goes out and investigates.

MAIN STORY
The heroine starts off her journey by heading off into the snow-covered forests in search of clues. She battles the ice fairy Cirno and the winter spirit Letty Whiterock in the forest, and the nekomata Chen in the village of Mayohiga, without any progress in her search. Finally, after defeating Alice Margatroid and her dolls, the heroine finds a lead when she notices several cherry blossoms blowing around in the sky. The heroine follows the trail of cherry blossoms high above Gensokyo, breaking through the greetings of Lily White, eventually reaching a great magical boundary and the poltergeist musicians Prismriver Sisters. After silencing the Prismriver Sisters, the heroine crosses the boundary into the Netherworld.

After fighting off several ghosts, the heroine is confronted by human-ghost gardener Youmu Konpaku. Youmu explains that she had been stealing the essence of ""spring"" throughout Gensokyo in order to make the Saigyou Ayakashi, a youkai cherry tree, bloom perfectly with the rest of Hakugyokurou's gardens, as per her master's orders. The heroine defeats Youmu and hurries to Hakugyokurou to get Gensokyo's spring back. Now at the end of a long journey, the heroine comes face to face with Yuyuko Saigyouji, the ghost princess of Hakugyokurou. Yuyuko reveals that she wanted to revive a certain soul that has been sealed within the Saigyou Ayakashi from before her existence. In order to break the seal, the youkai cherry blossom tree needed to bloom fully and completely. Yuyuko and the heroine wage a fierce battle, to get the last ""spring"" contained in the heroine needed for the Perfect Cherry Blossom, and to reclaim Gensokyo's spring, respectively. After the heroine defeats Yuyuko, the Saigyou Ayakashi starts to lose its health. However the seal has been weakened from the near-complete bloom, and the sealed soul is temporarily unleashed. The soul is actually Yuyuko's. The heroine dodges attack after attack until Yuyuko's soul is finally sealed once more.",2003-08-17 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.3040,17

The ORA then murder Richard, and abduct Emma as a mortal bride for Zeus so that he can gain complete power over the mortal world which, unsurprisingly, drives Will over the edge and leaves him in a rather unpleasant position. Luckily for Will the Titan god Prometheus, who happens to be in the market for recruits to destroy Zeus, was close by. With similar goals in mind, Prometheus imbues Will with power leaving him half-man, half-titan - perfect for Will to exact his revenge and rescue his damsel in distress.
